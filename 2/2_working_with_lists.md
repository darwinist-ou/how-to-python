# Accessing lists

If we run `2.0_list_index.py` we can see how to get a single item from a list of numbers.

You can see a demonstration of "slicing" in `2.1_list_slice.py`. Slices allow us to take a bunch of values from a list.

`print(a)` is a function that takes variable `a` and prints it out for a human to read.
