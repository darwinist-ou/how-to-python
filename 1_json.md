# JSON and data structures.

Before we can start coding we need to learn how computers think about data. Whilst we know that computers use 1 & 0 simple binary, programming languages provide us with easy to use data types.

## String 

A string is a sequence of characters wrapped in quotes. "Meow", "Woof", "Quack", "1234". A number becomes a string if it's inside quotes.

## Integer

An integer is a whole number such as 1, 2, 3 or 2048.

## Floating point number

Floating point number are decimal numbers such as 0.2, 1/5 or 455.22333. We call them "floating point" because it is not possible for a computer to store a true decimal number or fraction.
